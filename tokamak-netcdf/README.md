## tokamak-netcdf

A package for opening [NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) files of reconstructed tokamak equilibria and providing a more suitable interface for accessing the data and performing calculations.

## Notes

Requires the [netCDF-C](https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c) library, which is available in most linux package managers. In case it is not, it can be statically linked with the `netcdf/static' feature.
